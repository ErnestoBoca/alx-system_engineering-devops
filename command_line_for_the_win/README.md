# Command line for the win

This is a project to demostrate the use of the SFTP protocol, transfering some screanshots of the CMD CHALLENGE to the sandvox environment.

## Steps I used to transfer the files
1. First I made the screenshots on my local machine
2. Then I went to the "My Sandboxes" page on the intranet and copied the SFTP link for my sandbox
3. After that I opened a terminal on my local machine on the directory where the files are located and pasted the link
4. It asked me if I wanted to continue and I typed "Yes" and pressed Enter
5. Then it asked me for the password and I just copied the one available on the intranet and the connection was established
6. I went to the folder I wanted to transfer the screenshots to and used the command "put fileName" to transfer the files
